Get in touch to join my dedicated child health advice Whatsapp group.

For just Â£25 you can join the group for 3 months. This includes unlimited questions and advice via Whatsapp, and learning from each other's questions too.

This is for non-urgent medical advice only and should not replace urgent or emergency medical services. I aim to respond within 48 hours.
