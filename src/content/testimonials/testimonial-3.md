My husband and I don’t have much baby experience and it has been wonderful to be able to ask an expert when we have questions that arise. Dr. Lejay’s support and guidance has been invaluable as we get through the early weeks of my son’s life. I really appreciated her input when we have received conflicting information from other healthcare providers and when we have questions where a nuanced answer is required. Her calm approach and ability to explain medical concepts in ways non-medical parents can understand has helped us tremendously!

Thanks Shiri!
