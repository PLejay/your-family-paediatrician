If you're a first-time parent – then you NEED Shiri in your life.

Our move to London meant we were separated from our entire support network. While all the advice you get from family and friends is well-intentioned, we found that it wasn't sufficient to help us confidently act in any given situation – especially as they weren’t even in the same time zone!


Having Shiri to call and talk to – especially when unexpected medical situations come up, is absolutely invaluable. When they have a temperature, or a cough, or are fussy and unsettled. As a first-time parent, you don’t always know how to respond – and you need someone you can touch base with who can quickly help you assess what’s going on, in the moment.
